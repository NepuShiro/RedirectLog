# RedirectLog

#### A Plugin for [BepInEx](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/) that is made to redirect the logs of the game [Resonite](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2519830/Resonite/) to the BepInEx Console

### Installation
 Download and extract [BepInEx 5.4.22 x64](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases) into the main game folder and run the game once to generate the folders and config files

 You will also need to download [BCE](https://github.com/innominata/BepInEx-Console-Extensions/releases/tag/1.0) (BepInEx Console Extensions) and place this into the "GameDir"/BepInEx/Plugins

 Finally download the RedirectLog.dll from the [Releases](https://github.com/nepushiro/RedirectLog/releases) and place this into the "GameDir"/BepInEx/Plugins

To get the Console to appear it is disabled by default in the BepInEx config ("GameDir"/BepInEx/Config)

Now your Console should be displaying the logs!
